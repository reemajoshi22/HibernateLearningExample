			<!--for the first record, the id value will be inserted as 1
			for the second record the id value will be inserted as 32768
			for the next records the id value will be incremented by 32768 and will stores into the database (i mean adds to the previous)
			actually this hibernate stores the count of id values generated in a column of separated table, with name “hibernate_unique_key” by default with the column name “next_hi”
			if we want to modify the table and column names theen wee need to pass 2 parameter’s for the hilo generators-->
			<generator class="hilo"></generator>
				<!--when we use identity and if there are values already present then
			we cannot use identity cz it throws id doesn't have a default value-->
			<!--this identity generator is similar to increment generator,
			but the difference was increment generator is database independent and
			hibernate uses a select operation for selecting max of id before inserting new record-->


			<!--1 assigned means hibernate will understand that, while saving any object
			hibernate is not responsible to create any primary key
			value for the current inserting object, user has to take the response-->
			<!-- if generator class is other than assigned(means as a programmer we will give values) then we cannot use persist -->
			<!-- if we are using this generator class other thn assigned then we cannot use session.persist -->
